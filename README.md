# VulkanLearning

My Vulkan Learning Repo. The target is to build a real-time ray tracer using vulkan.

## Build

* Build Framework is originally from [BJTU Game Engine](https://github.com/YXHXianYu/BJTU-Game-Engine).
* If you also want to learn Vulkan from scratch, you can checkout commit `16df84c83d9a4b40a605e66fdaaf0a0c199f9634` to get a clean and convenient start.

## Learning Materials

* [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)
